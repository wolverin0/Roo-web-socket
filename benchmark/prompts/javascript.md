Your job is to complete a coding exercise described by `.docs/instructions.md`.

A file with the implementation stubbed out has been created for you, along with a test file.

To successfully complete the exercise, you must pass all the tests in the test file.

To confirm that your solution is correct, run the tests with `pnpm test`. Do not alter the test file; it should be run as-is.

Before running the tests make sure your environment is set up by running `pnpm install` to install the dependencies.
