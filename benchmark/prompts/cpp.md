Your job is to complete a coding exercise described by `.docs/instructions.md`.

A file with the implementation stubbed out has been created for you, along with a test file.

To successfully complete the exercise, you must pass all the tests in the test file.

To confirm that your solution is correct, you can compile your code and run the tests with:

```
mkdir -p build && cd build
cmake -G "Unix Makefiles" -DEXERCISM_RUN_ALL_TESTS=1 ..
make
```

Note that running `make` will compile the tests and generate compile time errors. Once the errors are fixed, running `make` will build and run the tests.

Do not alter the test file; it should be run as-is.
