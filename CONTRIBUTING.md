If you're planning to work on a bigger feature, please create a [feature request](https://github.com/RooVetGit/Roo-Code/discussions/categories/feature-requests?discussions_q=is%3Aopen+category%3A%22Feature+Requests%22+sort%3Atop) first so we can discuss whether it aligns with Roo Code's vision. You may also want to check our [Project Roadmap](#project-roadmap) below to see if your idea fits with our strategic direction.

## Project Roadmap

Roo Code has a clear development roadmap that guides our priorities and future direction. Understanding our roadmap can help you:

- Align your contributions with project goals
- Identify areas where your expertise would be most valuable
- Understand the context behind certain design decisions
- Find inspiration for new features that support our vision

Our current roadmap focuses on six key pillars:

### Provider Support

We aim to support as many providers well as we can:

- More versatile "OpenAI Compatible" support
- xAI, Microsoft Azure AI, Alibaba Cloud Qwen, IBM Watsonx, Together AI, DeepInfra, Fireworks AI, Cohere, Perplexity AI, FriendliAI, Replicate
- Enhanced support for Ollama and LM Studio

### Model Support

We want Roo to work as well on as many models as possible, including local models:

- Local model support through custom system prompting and workflows
- Benchmarking evals and test cases

### System Support

We want Roo to run well on everyone's computer:

- Cross platform terminal integration
- Strong and consistent support for Mac, Windows, and Linux

### Documentation

We want comprehensive, accessible documentation for all users and contributors:

- Expanded user guides and tutorials
- Clear API documentation
- Better contributor guidance
- Multilingual documentation resources
- Interactive examples and code samples

### Stability

We want to significantly decrease the number of bugs and increase automated testing:

- Debug logging switch
- "Machine/Task Information" copy button for sending in with bug/support requests

### Internationalization

We want Roo to speak everyone's language:

- Êàë‰ª¨Â∏åÊúõ Roo Code ËØ¥ÊØè‰∏™‰∫∫ÁöÑËØ≠Ë®Ä
- Queremos que Roo Code hable el idioma de todos
- ‡§π‡§Æ ‡§ö‡§æ‡§π‡§§‡•á ‡§π‡•à‡§Ç ‡§ï‡§ø Roo Code ‡§π‡§∞ ‡§ï‡§ø‡§∏‡•Ä ‡§ï‡•Ä ‡§≠‡§æ‡§∑‡§æ ‡§¨‡•ã‡§≤‡•á
- ŸÜÿ±ŸäÿØ ÿ£ŸÜ Ÿäÿ™ÿ≠ÿØÿ´ Roo Code ŸÑÿ∫ÿ© ÿßŸÑÿ¨ŸÖŸäÿπ

We especially welcome contributions that advance our roadmap goals. If you're working on something that aligns with these pillars, please mention it in your PR description.

## Development Setup

1. **Clone** the repo:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/RooVetGit/Roo-Code.git
```

2. **Install dependencies**:

```sh
npm run install:all
```

3. **Start the webview (Vite/React app with HMR)**:

```sh
npm run dev
```

4. **Debug**:
   Press `F5` (or **Run** ‚Üí **Start Debugging**) in VSCode to open a new session with Roo Code loaded.

Changes to the webview will appear immediately. Changes to the core extension will require a restart of the extension host.

Alternatively you can build a .vsix and install it directly in VSCode:

```sh
npm run build
```

A `.vsix` file will appear in the `bin/` directory which can be installed with:

```sh
code --install-extension bin/roo-cline-<version>.vsix
```

## Writing and Submitting Code

Anyone can contribute code to Roo Code, but we ask that you follow these guidelines to ensure your contributions can be smoothly integrated:

1. **Keep Pull Requests Focused**

    - Limit PRs to a single feature or bug fix
    - Split larger changes into smaller, related PRs
    - Break changes into logical commits that can be reviewed independently

2. **Code Quality**

    - All PRs must pass CI checks which include both linting and formatting
    - Address any ESLint warnings or errors before submitting
    - Respond to all feedback from Ellipsis, our automated code review tool
    - Follow TypeScript best practices and maintain type safety

3. **Testing**

    - Add tests for new features
    - Run `npm test` to ensure all tests pass
    - Update existing tests if your changes affect them
    - Include both unit tests and integration tests where appropriate

4. **Commit Guidelines**

    - Write clear, descriptive commit messages
    - Reference relevant issues in commits using #issue-number

5. **Before Submitting**

    - Rebase your branch on the latest main
    - Ensure your branch builds successfully
    - Double-check all tests are passing
    - Review your changes for any debugging code or console logs

6. **Pull Request Description**
    - Clearly describe what your changes do
    - Include steps to test the changes
    - List any breaking changes
    - Add screenshots for UI changes
